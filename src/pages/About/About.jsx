                 <h4>A Transnational Journey in Tech</h4> 
                 <p>Born in Colombia, later moved to Florida in pursuit of a better life and opportunities. My academic background includes a bachelor's degree in Engineering and a scholarship-awarded in Software Engineering at a bootcamp in Boca Raton. This educational journey ignited my passion for web development.</p>
                <p>The past two years have seen me involved in the development of robust web applications for startups, with the most recent year spent thriving as a Front-End Developer. The work I've done has not only enhanced my skills but has also significantly boosted the businesses I've worked with, leading to notable increases in monthly income.</p>
                <p>Collaboration, learning, and project creation with others are activities I thrive in and thoroughly enjoy. ðŸš€</p>
